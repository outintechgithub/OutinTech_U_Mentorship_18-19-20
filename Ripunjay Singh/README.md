Project Name: Email_Header_Analyzer

Project Description: The email header is the routing information or successfully delivering the email, that contains information about the sender, recipient, email's route to get to the inbox and various authentication results. Using Python, Jupyter notebooks and API's, I was able to analyze incoming email headers for crucial information and hence, filter them based on their spam status and phishing status.
