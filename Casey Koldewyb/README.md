Project Name: Social Media Campaign Management

Project Description: My mentor, Rachel Rapoza walked me through a social media campaign from idea creation, to posting. We'll look at KPI results once we have them later on as well. The campaign will run on the Out In Tech social channels to promote the U Mentorship program!
