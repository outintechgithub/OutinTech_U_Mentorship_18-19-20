Project Name: A study of Citi Bike utilization across NYC zip Codes

Project Description: The goal was to determine which zip codes Citi Bike should consider adding additional capacity in, using public datasets and tables in BigQuery with stations, trips, zip code, and population data. I executed SQL queries to conduct exploratory data analysis, answer key questions about the data, and complete joins and other functions across multiple tables to obtain the final table for analysis. I then analyzed the data in Excel across key metrics to come up with the end recommendations.
