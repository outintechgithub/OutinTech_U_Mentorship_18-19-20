Project Name: Donera

Project Description: Donera uses data to identify the nonprofits doing the best work to fight the climate crisis so you don’t have to. We distribute your donation, track it’s progress, and report it back to you. We’re designed to be transparent, efficient, and most importantly, impactful. For this project, we used user research (surveying, usability studies, etc), Figma, and core product skills to design a Donera that met users needs. Out goal is to making giving as easy and effective as possible!
