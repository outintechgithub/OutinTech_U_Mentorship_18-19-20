Project Name: Hi, I'm Kelly

Project Description: One of my 2020 goals was to build my personal website. Very excited to say that, unlike many of my other New Years' resolutions, this happened! Shoutout to my mentor Alex for helping me define my brand, develop an eye for design, and answer a million Bootstrap/HTML/CSS questions over the past few months.
