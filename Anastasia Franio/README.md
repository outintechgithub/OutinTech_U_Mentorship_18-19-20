Project Name: Can I Make a Recommendation? Python Recommender Systems

Project Description: Using an Instacart dataset available online, I wrote Python code that calculates relationships between consumer purchases and then predicts what aisles and products customers are most likely to visit or buy next. I then built a user interface so that others can test it out (still in progress). I used Python, Google Colab, Tkinter (a GUI), and Tableau.
