Project Name: Prediction of FAANG Stock Prices using VAR Modeling in R

Project Description: I looked at the set of FAANG companies (e.g. Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Alphabet) and valued them using multivariate time series analysis in R with validation from the Corporate Finance related topics. By researching a specific segment of the market that significantly influences it I developed an evaluation model to predict which company has better returns and therefore is the best candidate to invest in over 5 years.
